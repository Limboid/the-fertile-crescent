## Difference between the Artificial Experience and the Artificial School

The Artificial Experience provides a diverse experiences for training and developing general purpose

## Additional environments and pipeline components

- simulators: https://hash.ai/, list simulators and ask computatra interface explore them

- connect block-protocol compliant web3 sources to the unsupervised learning pipeline
